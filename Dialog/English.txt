SHERPLUNG_WINDHELPER_DEMO_START_SIGN=
Welcome to WindHelper!
This is a short demonstration map to get you acquainted with what mechanics, entities, and triggers this helper introduces.
There will be rooms demonstrating individual entities and triggers, 
followed with some gameplay concept rooms to give a small taste of how these entities can be used.
These signs will give more information when relevant.
Have fun mapping!

SHERPLUNG_WINDHELPER_DEMO_ADDWIND_SIGN=
This room will demonstrate the additive wind functionality that this helper uses for most of its entities.
Represented by seeker barriers are triggers that each add 200 strength wind for 7 seconds in various directions when entered.
The directions are Up, Down, Left, and Right, in order from left to right.
Additive wind sources stack, so try entering various combinations of these triggers to observe the behavior.
The jelly is there for visualization purposes. The wind snow is also custom and can move diagonally to visualize the direction of the wind.
While mapping, Add Wind (Components) triggers can be configured to add wind for a duration, for the rest of the room, or only while inside the trigger.
(Note: for all entities and triggers with configurable wind strength parameters,
it is advised to not make the difference between the wind strengths of any two have a difference of a size on the interval (0,1],
as that can cause errors with systems designed to counteract float imprecision (specifically the system that sets additive wind to zero when its magnitude is < 1).)

SHERPLUNG_WINDHELPER_DEMO_WINDEASE_SIGN=
You may have noticed that the additive wind eases to the target value differently than the wind in the base game does.
There are various options for how this easing works, accessible in the mod options.
The default setting for easing is to instantly change the wind speed to the target value when that value is not zero, but to ease slowly if the target value is zero and a source of wind just ended.
This maintains the snappy feel desired with the wind sources in this helper but alleviates the feeling of a gust abruptly ending.
For precision maps, an option to have no additive wind easing exists, among others.
Experiment and find what setting feels best for your map!

SHERPLUNG_WINDHELPER_DEMO_PINWHEEL_SIGN=
The first entity that will be shown off here is the Pinwheel.
Pinwheels work identically to bumpers, except that they produce a gust of wind in the direction that they were hit.
The duration and strength of this gust can be changed to any value to accommodate for room design or desired gameplay.
You cannot hit a Pinwheel again until the gust it produces ends, so one Pinwheel can only produce one gust at a time.

SHERPLUNG_WINDHELPER_DEMO_BELLOWS_SIGN=
Next up are the Bellows.
Bellows work like springs, except they produce a gust of wind in the direction they are hit.
Like Pinwheels, the strength and duration of this gust can be customized.
Unlike Pinwheels, however, Bellows can be hit multiple times to stack multiple gusts of wind at once.
Bellows also produce gusts when hit by throwables.

SHERPLUNG_WINDHELPER_DEMO_ANEMOMETER_SIGN=
This is the Anemometer.
Anemometers are throwables that allow you to create a gust of wind if you press dash while holding them.
The direction of this gust can be fixed to any one of eight directions, or set to go in the held direction.
As before, the duration and strength of this gust can be customized.
Like Pinwheels, Anemometers cannot produce a gust until the previous gust it created ends.
Anemometers can also have a number of charges defined.
An Anemometer can have any number of charges, but sprites only exist for 0, 1, 2, 3, and infinite charges (caused by setting the number of charges to be negative).
Any number of charges above 3 will cause the Anemometer to display the 3-charge sprite.
Charges are refreshed when the Anemometer or the player holding it touches the ground.
Anemometers share the same throwing physics as Theo crystals, sans the effect of slowing movement when held.
Although it produces wind, the Anemometer is not itself affected by it. 
This allows for unique regrabs to be performed using Anemometers of certain wind directions.
This entity is especially suited for experimentation, so have fun making interesting rooms with it!

SHERPLUNG_WINDHELPER_DEMO_FLOATINGBLOCK_SIGN=
This entity is called the Windblown Block.
Windblown Blocks are solids that are moved by wind.
Like Floaty Space Blocks, any static mover can be attached to a Windblown Block.
Additionally, Windblown Blocks have a "mass" parameter that affects the speed at which they are moved by wind.
A Windblown Block of mass 2 will be pushed half as much as a Windblown Block of mass 1, and one of mass 0.5 twice as much as one of mass 1.

SHERPLUNG_WINDHELPER_DEMO_FLOATINGSPINNER_SIGN=
This is the Windblown Spinner.
It's like the Windblown Block, except it's a spinner.
Windblown Spinners also have a mass value that affects how they are moved by wind, just like Windblown Blocks.

SHERPLUNG_WINDHELPER_DEMO_CONTROLLABLEWIND_SIGN=
Finally, we have the Controllable Wind Trigger.
As the name suggests, the Controllable Wind Trigger allows you to control the direction of the wind based on what direction you are holding.
The trigger has 4 behavior types: Add, Remove, Duration, and WhileInside.
The Add behavior adds 1 count of controllable wind at the specified strength when entered.
Multiple counts of controllable wind can exist at once, and their strengths all add together to make the ultimate strength of the controllable wind.
The Remove behavior removes 1 count of controllable wind of the specified strength.
If you intend for a Remove behavior trigger to disable the effects of an Add behavior trigger, make sure their strength values match.
Do not make the strength value of the Remove behavior trigger the negative of the Add behavior trigger. Make them identical.
If, for some reason, the strength values do not match, the total strength of controllable wind will be set to zero if there are no counts of controllable wind.
The Duration behavior adds one count of controllable wind at the specified strength for the specified duration, then removes it.
The WhileInside behavior adds a count of controllable wind at the specified strength when the trigger is entered, and removes it when leaving the trigger.
Controllable Wind Triggers can also be set to only activate once.
Controllable wind follows the held direction at all times, including when inside bubbles (boosters).
The three triggers here, represented by seeker barriers, Add, Remove, and add for 10 seconds controllable wind of strength 800, in order from left to right.

SHERPLUNG_WINDHELPER_DEMO_GP1_SIGN=
This is the first gameplay concept room.
These will be short, basically just a few inputs, but they may serve as inspiration for other rooms.

SHERPLUNG_WINDHELPER_DEMO_SNEAKING_SIGN=
Sneaking around, are you?
